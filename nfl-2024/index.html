        <h1>NFL 2024 Season Year-In Review</h1>
        <p class = "name-tag">By Chris Kourkoulakos</p>

        <p>Football. The word alone is enough to make a grown man cry. There's nothing like the excitement of watching your team in a close game, or the despair you feel
            when they inevitably blow it in the most unimaginable way possible. We've all been there but we keep coming back for more. Each season has its ups and downs. 
            New hope is created and previous hype is destroyed. As we power through the depression and withdrawal that the offseason brings, let us reminisce on the big story lines
            and trends of the previous season to fill our hearts with joy in this dark time without the game we love. 
        </p>
        <img src = "images/rhode_island.png">
        <p>We all love football and it's clear that Dan Campbell does as well. Since taking over as Lions head coach in 2021, he has had a reputation as a high roller, 
            consistently attempting to extend drives on fourth downs when other coaches would opt to punt or a kick a field goal. In fact, Dan Campbell loves attempting fourth down 
            conversions so much that even after a decline in the Lions' fourth down conversion attempt rate from 2023 to 2024, the Lions are <i>still</i> at the top of the league in that regard. 
            They had the highest fourth down attempt rate in 2023 and that trend carried through to last season as well. With the Lions recent success (and the fact that Dan Campbell still has 
            a pulse), there's little question that the Lions will look to continue their risky play calling antics in 2025.

        <p>If you've been in a coma for the last half-decade, you might have missed the start of the whole Dan Campbell saga in Detroit and the revival of the Lions. You might also be hoping for a new mix of 
            Super Bowl contenders and excited to see who the new favorites are after the inevitable fall-off of the Chiefs dynasty. To that I say try waking up in another half-decade because the Chiefs dynasty 
            is still alive and well. The good news is that they are starting to look at least somewhat beatable:
        </p>
        <img src = "images/rhode_island.png">
        <p>For all the Chiefs fans out there, here are a couple facts to give you hope:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Since Mahomes became the starter, the Chiefs have made it to the Super Bowl or AFC Championship game every year, with 3 of those years ending with a Super Bowl victory</li>
            <li>The Chiefs are coming off a franchise-record 15 win season</li>
        </ol> 
        <p>Now for the rest of us, here are another couple things to keep in mind:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Most of the Chiefs' 15 wins this past season came from black-magic voodoo late in the fourth quarter</li>
            <li>Patrick Mahomes' voice still very much sounds like Kermit the Frog (not a diss at Kermit, it's just entertaining)</li>
        </ol>
        <p>In all seriousness, what the Chiefs have done over the last decade has been nothing short of remarkable. Even in what felt like a "down" year the Chiefs were still able 
            to reach the Super Bowl and somehow sneak 15 wins out of the regular season through their late game heroics (and a healthy dose of luck and favorable calls). While their record and 
            season outcomes suggest that they will continue to be Super Bowl favorites for many years to come, this past season has some thinking that it's only a matter of time before the luck runs out.
        </p>

        <p>Building on the theme of new developments on old trends, no storyline from 2024 is more fitting than that of Saquon Barkley. We always knew he was good at football, but this past year showed that 
            Saquon is <i>really</i> good at football. Perhaps it was the change of scenery (but more likely the upgraded offensive line play) that vaulted Saquon's status to be one of the most elite running 
            backs in the league.
        </p>
        <img src = "images/rhode_island.png">
        <p>Look away Giants fans. Saquon not only had a career year in his first season away from the G-Men, he had a <i>historic</i> year. Had the Eagles not rested him in the last week of the season,
        he would have had the chance to break Eric Dickerson's single season rushing record for the regular season. </p>

        <p>There aren't many people on our beloved planet that are capable of jumping backwards over a 6 foot 200 pound man trying to knock the living daylight out of you, then proceed to rush for over 2000 yards in a season. 
            Thankfully for us, Saquon Barkley is indeed one of those people. Was this just an outlier of a season or have the Eagles really unlocked a new potential for Saquon? T-minus four months until we find out.
